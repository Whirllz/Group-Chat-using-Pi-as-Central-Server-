GROUP CHAT IN UNIX ENVIRONMENT USING RASPBERRY PI 3 AS CONCURRENT SERVER

Group chat between clients with Raspberry Pi acting as aconcurrent server maintaining the chat records and allowing
each client to send and receive data in its network.
The concurrent server was implemented in Raspberry Pi 3 running on UNIX Operating System remotely using Putty (SSH
client).
C programming language was used for implementing client and server in UNIX environment.
The Group chat allowed clients to communicate with each other, which we tested using 5 clients and raspberry pi 3 as a
server.
